# Pulze 
## Potheri FC

Greetings, 
We at the team Potheri FC, decided to take on challanges in Healthcare, IOT, Cybersecurity as part of the Data Science Hackathon that took place at SRMIST. 

Pulze is a real-time health monitor; we have developed it and aim to improve it further in time. This product collects various data from users at regular intervals and utilizes smart Machine learning models to understand if the user is likely to suffer a medical emergency in the near future. The product comes with a wearable device which collects sensor data from users which is provided to an online platform for doctors to monitor their patients' physical state. We understand the confidentiality of medical records and hence place a huge importance on the security of our platform.
